# smARtGully
Currently, enormous electric energy is consumed by the street lamps and this amount of energy wastage should be stopped. Our smARtGully project focuses on reducing the amount of electrical energy consumed by street lamps. With the help of IoT we can automatically turn on when it's dark and turn off when it's  bright. When the sensor detects darkness it activates motion sensor, this sensor can turn on the lights when pedestrians or vehicles are detected and turn off or reduce power when nothing is detected. Everyday at a specified time the operator will receive a notification regarding the power consumption of the previous day. The user interface allows the operator to monitor the live power consumption of any particular area and and it can also be done using an android application, the street lights' user interface apart from power consumption data it also shows malfunction of any light in that region which makes it easy for the maintenance of the lights.
